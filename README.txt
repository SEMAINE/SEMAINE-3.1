The latest documentation on building, installing and running 
the SEMAINE-3.1 system can be found at 
http://semaine.opendfki.de/wiki/SEMAINE-3.1. We will soon move this content to the new GitHub space.

The GitHub project location is https://github.com/organizations/SEMAINE/

Quickstart guide for Windows:
1. If you have a camera and a fast PC, install the SEMAINE video components from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources
2a. To run the full system on one machine (you should have 8 or more cores  @ >2GHz), just run "start.bat"
2b. To run a speech2speech (no 3D agent, and no video input analysis) system, run bin/semaine-speech2speech.bat  and after a few seconds start Opensmile/start_openSMILE.bat
3. Wait for the system monitor GUI to display the status "ready", then say Hi.
