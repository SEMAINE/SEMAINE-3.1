# This file contains the parameters to the Klatt duration rules as used in
# the "Cap" module of the "Mary" Text-to-Speech Synthesis system.
# The parameters are read in during runtime. Their meaning is described in
# the accompanying comments.
# For a description of the Klatt rules, see

#
# Syntax of this file:
# This is a java properties file.
# Comments: everything between a numerical (#) and a line break is a comment.
# Empty lines may occur anywhere.

# Overall stretch factor
rule0.all = 120

# Pause duration, in ms, depending on the break index,
# on the speech rate, and on the "pause-duration" attribute.
# The names "verylong", "long", "medium", "short" and "veryshort"
# correspond to points a combined rate*pauseduration measure, at
# 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150.
# Linear interpolation occurs for intermediate values and beyond the
# extreme points. 
# Notice that the decision whether to realise a boundary of 
# a given size (breakindex) is independent of these duration values.
# (this depends on rate and the "number-of-pauses" attribute).
