<!-- This file contains the parameters to the rules for the realisation of
 ToBI accent and boundary tones, as used in
 the CAP module of the Mary Text-to-Speech Synthesis system.

 Author: Marc Schröder.

 The parameters are read at program start. Their meaning is described in
 the accompanying comments.

 Syntax of this file:
 This is an XML file.
 Accents and boundaries are defined as a set of target points,
 some of which are conditional.
 Each target point is defined by its type, an f0 specification,
 and a code specifying the position of the time axis.

 a) Types of targetpoints:
  begin    the very first, default target in a declination phrase
  interpol relatively unimportant target needed for interpolation
  plus     the weaker part of a composed accent (the l in l+h*)
  star     the important part of an accent (the h in l+h*)
  boundary non-final, but important target in boundary tone
  final    the very last target in a boundary tone

 b) Generally, f0-axis values (describing the fundamental frequency)
 are in o/oo, where 0 is the baseline and 1000 is the topline.
 If the value of the f0 attribute is not numerical, it is an exceptional way
 to specify f0:
  last_H_freq same *frequency* value as the preceding target on the topline.

 c) t values (position on the time axis) are coded in the following way:
   0 start of this declination phrase
  11 start of the preceding syllable
  12 start of the nucleus of the preceding syllable
  21 start of this syllable
  22 start of the nucleus of this syllable
  23 middle of the nucleus of this syllable
  24 end of the nucleus of this syllable
  25 end of this syllable
  34 end of the nucleus of the following syllable
 and some more specific ones:
  99 middle of the nucleus of the syllable after the (syllable associated
     with) the previous tone
  98 middle of the nucleus of the first 1ary or 2ary stressed syllable after
     the syllable after the (syllable associated with) the previous tone
     (i.e., skip one syllable and then search for a stressed syllable)
