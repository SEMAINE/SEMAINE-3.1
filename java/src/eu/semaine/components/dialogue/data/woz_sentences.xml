         &lt;b&gt;Hi. You have reached SAL, the Sensitive Artificial Listeners.
         If you want to know about the system from scratch, go ahead and ask.
         If you already know, go ahead and say which of us you want to talk to.
         These are the listeners you can choose.&lt;/b&gt;

         &lt;ul&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Poppy is cheerful, optimistic and she looks on the bright
         side of life!&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Spike is aggressive, confrontational and he enjoys an
         argument&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Obadiah is gloomy, and he has a pessimistic
         outlook&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;Prudence is matter-of-fact, and takes a practical view on
         life&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;/ul&gt;
      </welcome>
      <instructions title="Introducing SALAS - Sensitive Artificial Listeners Associated">
         SALAS is a package designed to let a user work through various
         emotional states.
         &lt;p&gt;
         The package contains four 'personalities' who listen to the user and
         respond to what he/she says. Each of the 'personalities' has different
         emotional characteristics. The user controls the emotional tone of the
         interaction by choosing which 'personality' he/she talks to. He/she
         can change the tone at any time by choosing a different personality to
         talk to.
         
         &lt;h2&gt;Using SALAS&lt;/h2&gt;

         The personalities are very crude. They do not understand content, only
         tone. That means it is up to the user to work within the system's
         limits. In particular,
         
         &lt;ul&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;There is no point asking it questions&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;There is no point trying to get into a serious discussion
         with it&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;There is no point going into long monologues&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li&gt;There is no point trying to outwit it - that is so easy it
         is not much fun.&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;/ul&gt;

         The trick is to make use of what the system does offer - a kind of
         sounding board, which will make the sorts of noises you ask for.
         &lt;p&gt;
         That is a very limited function - but you might be surprised how much
         you can do with it.
