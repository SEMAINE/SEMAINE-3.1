		<response id="#Greta1" response="My name is Greta and I am responsible for some computer characters that call themselves sensitive artificial listeners."/>
		<response id="#Greta2" response="We will talk to them in a minute, but first I am going to tell you a bit about how the system operates."/>
		<response id="#Greta3" response="The first thing you have to understand is that talking to the listeners is a bit like hitting a tennis ball against the wall."/>
		<response id="#Greta4" response="You have to supply all the ideas and the effort, the listeners just bounce things back at you."/>
		<response id="#Greta5" response="The fun is that the ball can come back at some very odd angles."/>
		<response id="#Greta6" response="Sometimes they'll just go along with you for a bit, nice and predictable. Then they'll say something absolutely wild."/>
		<response id="#Greta7" response="That is just part of the interaction."/>
		<response id="#Greta8" response="You might ask why you would want to do this. Well, I'll tell you."/>
		<response id="#Greta9" response="Tennis is about exercising your body."/>
		<response id="#Greta10" response="This is about exercising your emotions."/>
		<response id="#Greta11" response="The listeners pick up on your emotions, and try to move you around the emotional court."/>
		<response id="#Greta12" response="Because they are just bits of program, they can sometimes say things that you wouldn't take from a real human."/>
		<response id="#Greta13" response="Think of those occasions as a kind of invitation to respond in a way you wouldn't if it wad a real human."/>
		<response id="#Greta14" response="They let rip at you, and you let rip at them."/>
		<response id="#Greta15" response="And if you play the game, you can come out feeling you've has a real good workout."/>
		<response id="#Greta16" response="That's the gist of it."/>
		<response id="#Greta17" response="Now there are just two more things before I let you loose on the listeners."/>
		<response id="#Greta18" response="First, remember that the listeners are just a complicated wall."/>
		<response id="#Greta19" response="You have to speak at them."/>
		<response id="#Greta20" response="There's no point asking them questions, or trying to outwit them, or anything like that."/>

		<response id="#Greta25" response="Then there's Poppy."/>
		<response id="#Greta26" response="She's a happy dippy party girl, and her mission in life is to make you as happy as she is."/>
		<response id="#Greta27" response="Then there's Prudence."/>
		<response id="#Greta28" response="She's sensible about everything, and she expects you to be sensible too."/>
		<response id="#Greta29" response="Then last of all, there's Obadiah."/>
		<response id="#Greta30" response="Obadiah is the soul of misery, and he thinks everybody should be miserable, including you."/>
		<response id="#Greta31" response="So there you are. Spike, Poppy, Prudence, Obadiah."/>
		<response id="#Greta32" response="It's up to you which you start with; and when you've had enough, you can ask to speak to the next one; and the next one; and so on."/>
		<response id="#Greta33" response="It's all easy enough."/>
		<response id="#Greta34" response="Just answer their questions, talk to them and let the conversation flow from there, see if you can get a rally going?"/>
