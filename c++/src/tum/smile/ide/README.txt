This directory containes the openSMILE project file for DevCPP.

The project is not yet compelete, you can load it and open source files and edit them,
however you CAN NOT compile smile under windows from DevCPP with this project yet. We will be working on compilation support under MinGW/Cygwin for at least the openSMILE standalone version. We will then update the project accordingly. 

If someone wants to create or needs as MS-VS project file for openSMILE: Volunteers are very welcome!
