About openSMILE:
================

openSMILE is a complete and open toolkit for audio analysis, processing and classification especially targeted at speech and music applications, e.g. ASR, emotion recognition, or beat tracking and chord detection.
The toolkit is developed at the Institute for Human-Machine Communication at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen in Munich, Germany.
It was started withtin the SEMAINE EU FP7 project.

The following components are currently available in openSMILE:

 * SMILExtract   -  Standalone commandline feature extractor
 * SMILErec      -  Commandline audio recorder
 * SMILEsync     -  AV sync tool used in the SEMAINE project
 * SEMAINExtract -  Feature extractor (SEMAINE component version)

Third-party dependencies:
=========================

openSMILE uses LibSVM (by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin) for classification tasks. It is included in the svm/ directory in the release.

PortAudio is required for live recording from sound card and for the SEMAINE component.
You can get it from: http://www.portaudio.com
