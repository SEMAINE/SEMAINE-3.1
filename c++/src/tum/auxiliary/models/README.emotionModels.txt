For the emotion models, create a folder emo/ in this folder.

Download the emotion models from:
 http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/~eyb/semaine/


You cannot browse the directory on the webserver, thus I provide a list of availabel filenames here (append them to the URL):
  emoModelsSVM_SetAfull.zip
  emoModelsSVM_SetAsmall.zip
  emoModelsSVM_SetBCsmall.zip
  emoModelsSVM_SetBCling.zip
  emoModelsSVM_SetBfull.zip
  emoModelsSVM_SetCfull.zip

You will need at least 
  emoModelsSVM_SetBCling.zip
and probably
  emoModelsSVM_SetBCsmall.zip
(for models without linguistic cues)

Unpack the file(s) in the (models/emo/) directory.
