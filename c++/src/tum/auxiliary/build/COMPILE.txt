This file contains information on how to build the Windows openSMILE Semaine component.
=======================================================================

This document assumes that you have obtained the SemaineAPI and System code from SVN and you have created the following directories in the semaine root directory:
  thirdparty/
  thirdparty/build

Moreover you must create the directory
  c++/src/tum/opensmile  (if it does not already exist)
and change to this directory and then type:
  svn co https://opensmile.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opensmile/trunk .
(or perform this checkout with a client like TortoiseSVN, etc. Thereby it is important to select the trunk directory. You should have the opensmile files directly in the opensmile directory after the checkout, you may not have a trunk, tags and branches directory there!)

Now you are ready to follow these steps to build the Semaine system and the openSMILE component:

0.) If you don't already have it, download and install the
    "Microsoft® Windows® Software Development Kit Update for Windows Vista™"
    If should create a directory C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A
    with Lib\ and Include\ directories in it.



4a.) Open the Visual Studio 2005 solution c++/vs2005/semaine.sln

4b.) Now, build the semaine solution (semaine.sln). Be sure to build the "Release" configuration. If you are a developer, also build the "Debug" configuration.

While building, you can perform the following steps in parallel:
5.) Get the Julius LVCSR engine (Version 4.1.2 !),
    from http://www.mmk.ei.tum.de/~eyb/semaine/julius-4.1.2.tar.gz 
    unpack it to thirdparty/build/julius-win

6.) Run c++/src/tum/julius4.mod/winpatch.bat 
    This will apply patches to the Julius code and copy VS05 build projects.

7.) Now open thirdparty/build/julius-win/vs05/julius.sln and build it. (Be sure to select the Release configuration!)
    (Build the Debug configuration too, if you are a developer)
    If you get an error that "strings.h" is not found (referenced in stddefs.h), then simply comment out this line in stddefs.h, and rebuild.

8.) Get the latest Portaudio SVN snapshot, 
    from http://www.portaudio.com
    unpack it to thirdparty/build/portaudio-win

9.) Copy the files "portaudio.vcproj" and "portaudio.def" 
    from c++/src/tum/auxiliary/build/vs05 
    to thirdparty/build/portaudio-win/build/msvc, replacing the existing files there
	(this will disable unnecessary APIs and build only the basic Windows Media API)

10.) Build the portaudio solution 
    (thirdparty/build/portaudio-win/build/msvc/portaudio.sln)
    (Be sure to select the "Release" configuration. Build the Debug configuration too, if you are a developer)

[ This is no longer required:! 
11.) Copy openSmile*.vcproj, *.vsprops, and openSmile*.sln 
     from c++/src/tum/auxiliary/build/vs05 
     to c++/src/tum/opensmile/ide/vs05/ 
]

== Now, please wait until the build of semaine.sln has finished, before proceeding ! ==

12.) Build the "openSmileSemaineComponent.sln" solution
     (in c++/src/tum/opensmile/ide/vs05/)

Note: If you get errors like: error C2146: syntax error : missing ';' before identifier 'cond'
      Then you must open the property sheet "openSmileSemaine", and remove the __VISTA preprocessor define
      from the C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions field (at the end).
      Your are probably building on Windows XP system.
      If you are building on Vista or Windows 7, then you must update your VS2005 installation for Vista:
        Get the Windows 2008 SDK (Version 6.1), install it and run the Visual 2005 Registration Tool (from the Start Menu, Microsoft SDK v6.1)
      (openSMILE uses native Windows condition variables on Vista and Windows 7 for thread synchronisation.)

Note: If you get errors concerning unresolved symbols to some openSMILE components, you may have to add these files to the
      openSmileLibPASemaine project. We frequently add new components to openSMILE, however we do not constantly sync the SEMAINE
      build projects for visual studio. Just look for the component names in the error Messages beginning with "c" (e.g. cPitchXXXX)
      and find the according files in the src/ directory and add them to the project. It should compile then.
      Please report these kind of problems to the openSMILE developers. We will then commit your updated VS project to the SVN.

13.) Copy the required dll files to the directory 
       c++/src/tum/opensmile  (or to a system wide path)

     Copy these files from thirdparty\build:
       portaudio-win\portaudio_x86Release.dll
       (portaudio-win\portaudio_x86Debug.dll)
     and the dlls from vs2005/depends/dll/*.dll


[ OUTDATED: the .bat must be updated!
     You can also use the batch script "c++/src/tum/auxiliary/build/copy_libs.bat" to copy the dll files to the correct path
]


14.) Now start the openSMILE Semaine component using "bin/semaine-openSMILE-run.bat"
