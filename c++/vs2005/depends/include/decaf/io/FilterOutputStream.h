     * This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output
     * streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output
     * stream (the underlying output stream) which it uses as its basic
     * sink of data, but possibly transforming the data along the way or
     * providing additional functionality.
     *
     * The class FilterOutputStream itself simply overrides all methods of
     * OutputStream with versions that pass all requests to the underlying
     * output stream. Subclasses of FilterOutputStream may further override
     * some of these methods as well as provide additional methods and
     * fields.
     *
     * Due to the lack of garbage collection in C++ a design decision was
     * made to add a boolean parameter to the constructor indicating if the
     * wrapped <code>InputStream</code> is owned by this object.  That way
     * creation of the underlying stream can occur in a Java like way. Ex:
     *
     *  DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream( new OutputStream(), true )
