    /**
     * A container for data of a specific primitive type.
     *
     * A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific primitive
     * type. Aside from its content, the essential properties of a buffer are
     * its capacity, limit, and position:
     *
     * A buffer's capacity is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a
     * buffer is never negative and never changes.
     *
     * A buffer's limit is the index of the first element that should not be read
     * or written. A buffer's limit is never negative and is never greater than its
     * capacity.
     *
     * A buffer's position is the index of the next element to be read or written.
     * A buffer's position is never negative and is never greater than its limit.
     *
     * There is one subclass of this class for each non-boolean primitive type.
     *
     * Transferring data:
     *   Each subclass of this class defines two categories of get and put operations:
     *   * Relative operations read or write one or more elements starting at the
     *     current position and then increment the position by the number of
     *     elements transferred. If the requested transfer exceeds the limit then a
     *     relative get operation throws a BufferUnderflowException and a relative
     *     put operation throws a BufferOverflowException; in either case, no data
     *     is transferred.
     *   * Absolute operations take an explicit element index and do not affect the
     *     position. Absolute get and put operations throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException
     *     if the index argument exceeds the limit.
     *
     *  Data may also, of course, be transferred in to or out of a buffer by the I/O
     *  operations of an appropriate channel, which are always relative to the current
     *  position.
     *
     * Marking and resetting:
     *
     *   A buffer's mark is the index to which its position will be reset when the
     *   reset method is invoked. The mark is not always defined, but when it is
     *   defined it is never negative and is never greater than the position. If the
     *   mark is defined then it is discarded when the position or the limit is
     *   adjusted to a value smaller than the mark. If the mark is not defined then
     *   invoking the reset method causes an InvalidMarkException to be thrown.
     *
     * Invariants:
     *
     *   The following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and capacity values:
     *     0 <= mark <= position <= limit <= capacity
     *
     *   A newly-created buffer always has a position of zero and a mark that is
     *   undefined.  The initial limit may be zero, or it may be some other value that
     *   depends upon the type of the buffer and the manner in which it is constructed.
     *   The initial content of a buffer is, in general, undefined.
     *
     * Clearing, flipping, and rewinding:
     *
     *   In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity values
     *   and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following operations
     *   upon buffers:
     *
     *    clear() makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of channel-read or relative
     *    put operations: It sets the limit to the capacity and the position to zero.
     *
     *    flip() makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of channel-write or relative
     *    get operations: It sets the limit to the current position and then sets the
     *    position to zero.
     *
     *    rewind() makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that it already
     *    contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position to zero.
     *
     * Read-only buffers:
     *
     *   Every buffer is readable, but not every buffer is writable. The mutation
     *   methods of each buffer class are specified as optional operations that will
     *   throw a ReadOnlyBufferException when invoked upon a read-only buffer. A
     *   read-only buffer does not allow its content to be changed, but its mark,
     *   position, and limit values are mutable. Whether or not a buffer is read-only
     *   may be determined by invoking its isReadOnly method.
     *
     * Thread safety:
     *
     *   Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a buffer is to
     *   be used by more than one thread then access to the buffer should be controlled
     *   by appropriate synchronization.
     *
     * Invocation chaining:
     *
     *   Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are specified
     *   to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations
     *   to be chained; for example, the sequence of statements
     *
     *     b.flip();
     *     b.position(23);
     *     b.limit(42);
     *
     *   can be replaced by the single, more compact statement
     *     b.flip().position(23).limit(42);
