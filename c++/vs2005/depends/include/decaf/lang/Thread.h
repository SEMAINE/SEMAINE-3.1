    /**
     * A {@code Thread} is a concurrent unit of execution. It has its own call stack for
     * methods being invoked, their arguments and local variables. Each process has at
     * least one main {@code Thread} running when it is started; typically, there are
     * several others for housekeeping. The application might decide to launch additional
     * {@code Thread}s for specific purposes.
     *
     * {@code Thread}s in the same process interact and synchronize by the use of shared
     * objects and monitors associated with these objects.
     *
     * There are basically two main ways of having a {@code Thread} execute application
     * code. One is providing a new class that extends {@code Thread} and overriding
     * its {@link #run()} method. The other is providing a new {@code Thread} instance
     * with a {@link Runnable} object during its creation. In both cases, the
     * {@link #start()} method must be called to actually execute the new {@code Thread}.
     *
     * Each {@code Thread} has an integer priority that basically determines the amount
     * of CPU time the {@code Thread} gets. It can be set using the {@link #setPriority(int)}
     * method. A {@code Thread} can also be made a daemon, which makes it run in the
     * background. The latter also affects VM termination behavior: the VM does not
     * terminate automatically as long as there are non-daemon threads running.
