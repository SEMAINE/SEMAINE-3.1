     * A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain no
     * pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1 == e2, and at most one null element.
     * As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.
     *
     * The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly, that all constructors
     * must create a set that contains no duplicate elements (as defined above).
     *
     * Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set elements.
     * The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a
     * manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the set.
     *
