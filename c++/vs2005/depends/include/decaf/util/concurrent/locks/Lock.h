    /**
     * Lock implementations provide more extensive locking operations than can be
     * obtained using synchronized statements. They allow more flexible structuring,
     * may have quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
     * Condition objects.
     *
     * A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by multiple
     * threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a shared resource:
     * only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and all access to the shared
     * resource requires that the lock be acquired first. However, some locks may
     * allow concurrent access to a shared resource, such as the read lock of a
     * ReadWriteLock.
     *
     * While the scoping mechanism for synchronized statements makes it much easier
     * easier to program with monitor locks, and helps avoid many common programming
     * errors involving locks, there are occasions where you need to work with locks
     * in a more flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing concurrently
     * accessed data structures require the use of "hand-over-hand" or
     * "chain locking": you acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A
     * and acquire C, then release B and acquire D and so on. Implementations of the
     * Lock interface enable the use of such techniques by allowing a lock to be
     * acquired and released in different scopes, and allowing multiple locks to be
     * acquired and released in any order.
     *
     * With this increased flexibility comes additional responsibility. The absence of
     * block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with
     * synchronized statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:
     *
     *    Lock l = ...;
     *    l.lock();
     *    try {
     *        // access the resource protected by this lock
     *    } catch(...) {
     *        l.unlock();
     *    }
     *
     * When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure
     * that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-catch
     * ensure that the lock is released when necessary.
     *
     * Lock implementations provide additional functionality over the use of synchronized
     * methods and statements by providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock
     * (tryLock()), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be interrupted (lockInterruptibly(),
     * and an attempt to acquire the lock that can timeout (tryLock(long, TimeUnit)).
     *
     * Note that Lock instances are just normal objects and can themselves be used as the
     * target in a synchronized statement.
     *
     * The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed)
     * may differ in their performance characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other
     * implementation qualities. Further, the ability to interrupt the ongoing acquisition
     * of a lock may not be available in a given Lock class. Consequently, an implementation
     * is not required to define exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms
     * of lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an ongoing lock
     * acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and
     * guarantees provided by each of the locking methods. It must also obey the interruption
     * semantics as defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
     * acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on method entry.
     *
     * As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption are
     * often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal
     * method return. This is true even if it can be shown that the interrupt occurred after
     * another action may have unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this
     * behavior.
