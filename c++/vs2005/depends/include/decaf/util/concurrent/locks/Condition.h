     * Condition factors out the Mutex monitor methods (wait, notify  and notifyAll) into
     * distinct objects to give the effect of having multiple wait-sets per object, by
     * combining them with the use of arbitrary Lock implementations. Where a Lock replaces
     * the use of synchronized statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor
     * methods.
     *
     * Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) provide a means for
     * one thread to suspend execution (to "wait") until notified by another thread that some
     * state condition may now be true. Because access to this shared state information occurs
     * in different threads, it must be protected, so a lock of some form is associated with
     * the condition. The key property that waiting for a condition provides is that it
     * atomically releases the associated lock and suspends the current thread.
     *
     * A Condition instance is intrinsically bound to a lock. To obtain a Condition instance
     * for a particular Lock instance use its newCondition() method.
     *
     * As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports put and take methods.
     * If a take is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread will block until an item
     * becomes available; if a put is attempted on a full buffer, then the thread will block
     * until a space becomes available. We would like to keep waiting put threads and take
     * threads in separate wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of only notifying a
     * single thread at a time when items or spaces become available in the buffer. This can
     * be achieved using two Condition instances.
     *
     *   class BoundedBuffer {
     *      Lock* lock = new ReentrantLock();
     *      Condition* notFull  = lock->newCondition();

     *    }
     *
     * (The ArrayBlockingQueue class provides this functionality, so there is no reason to
     * implement this sample usage class.)
     *
     * Implementation Considerations
     *
     * When waiting upon a Condition, a "spurious wakeup" is permitted to occur, in general,
     * as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has little practical impact
     * on most application programs as a Condition should always be waited upon in a loop,
     * testing the state predicate that is being waited for. An implementation is free to
     * remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is recommended that applications
     * programmers always assume that they can occur and so always wait in a loop.
     *
     * The three forms of condition waiting (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed)
     * may differ in their ease of implementation on some platforms and in their performance
     * characteristics. In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and
     * maintain specific semantics such as ordering guarantees. Further, the ability to
     * interrupt the actual suspension of the thread may not always be feasible to
     * implement on all platforms.
     *
     * Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same guarantees
     * or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it required to support interruption
     * of the actual suspension of the thread.
     *
     * An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided
     * by each of the waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption
     * of thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined in this
     * interface.
     *
     * As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption are often
     * infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method
     * return. This is true even if it can be shown that the interrupt occurred after another
     * action may have unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
