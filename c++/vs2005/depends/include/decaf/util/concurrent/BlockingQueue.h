    /**
     * A {@link java.util.Queue} that additionally supports operations that wait for
     * the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space
     * to become available in the queue when storing an element.
     *
     * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt> methods come in four forms, with different ways of
     * handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied
     * at some point in the future:
     * one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
     * <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, depending on the operation), the third
     * blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
     * and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
     * up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:
     *
     * <p>
     * <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>
     *  <tr>
     *    <td></td>
     *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Throws exception</em></td>
     *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Boolean Flag</em></td>
     *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Blocks</em></td>
     *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Times out</em></td>
     *  </tr>
     *  <tr>
     *    <td><b>Insert</b></td>
     *    <td>{@link #add add(e)}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #offer offer(e)}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #put put(e)}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #offer(Object, long, TimeUnit) offer(e, time, unit)}</td>
     *  </tr>
     *  <tr>
     *    <td><b>Remove</b></td>
     *    <td>{@link #remove remove()}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #poll poll()}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #take take()}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #poll(long, TimeUnit) poll(time, unit)}</td>
     *  </tr>
     *  <tr>
     *    <td><b>Examine</b></td>
     *    <td>{@link #element element()}</td>
     *    <td>{@link #peek peek()}</td>
     *    <td><em>not applicable</em></td>
     *    <td><em>not applicable</em></td>
     *  </tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> may be capacity bounded. At any given time it may have
     * a <tt>remainingCapacity</tt> beyond which no additional elements can be <tt>put</tt>
     * without blocking.  A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> without any intrinsic capacity
     * constraints always reports a remaining capacity of <tt>Integer::MAX_VALUE</tt>.
     *
     * <p> <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> implementations are designed to be used primarily for
     * producer-consumer queues, but additionally support {@link decaf.util.Collection}
     * interface.  So, for example, it is possible to remove an arbitrary element from a
     * queue using <tt>remove(x)</tt>. However, such operations are in general <em>not</em>
     * performed very efficiently, and are intended for only occasional use, such as
     * when a queued message is cancelled.
     *
     * <p> <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> implementations are thread-safe.  All queuing methods
     * achieve their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms of concurrency
     * control. However, the <em>bulk</em> Collection operations <tt>addAll</tt>,
     * <tt>containsAll</tt>, <tt>retainAll</tt> and <tt>removeAll</tt> are <em>not</em>
     * necessarily performed atomically unless specified otherwise in an implementation.
     * So it is possible, for example, for <tt>addAll(c)</tt> to fail (throwing an exception)
     * after adding only some of the elements in <tt>c</tt>.
     *
     * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> does <em>not</em> intrinsically support any kind of
     * &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to indicate that no more
     * items will be added.  The needs and usage of such features tend to be
     * implementation-dependent. For example, a common tactic is for producers to
     * insert special <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
     * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
     *
     * <p>
     * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.  Note that a
     * <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> can safely be used with multiple producers and multiple
     * consumers.
