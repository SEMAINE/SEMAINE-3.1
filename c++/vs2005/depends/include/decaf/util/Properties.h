        /**
         * Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input character stream in a
         * simple line-oriented format.
         * <p>
         * Properties are processed in terms of lines. There are two kinds of line, natural lines
         * and logical lines. A natural line is defined as a line of characters that is terminated
         * either by a set of line terminator characters (\n or \r or \r\n) or by the end of the
         * stream. A natural line may be either a blank line, a comment line, or hold all or some
         * of a key-element pair. A logical line holds all the data of a key-element pair, which
         * may be spread out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping the line terminator
         * sequence with a backslash character \. Note that a comment line cannot be extended in
         * this manner; every natural line that is a comment must have its own comment indicator,
         * as described below. Lines are read from input until the end of the stream is reached.
         * <p>
         * A natural line that contains only white space characters is considered blank and is
         * ignored. A comment line has an ASCII '#' or '!' as its first non-white space character;
         * comment lines are also ignored and do not encode key-element information. In addition
         * to line terminators, this format considers the characters space (' '), tab ('\t'),
         * and form feed ('\f') to be white space.
         * <p>
         * If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the backslash escaping the
         * line terminator sequence, the line terminator sequence, and any white space at the
         * start of the following line have no affect on the key or element values. The remainder
         * of the discussion of key and element parsing (when loading) will assume all the
         * characters constituting the key and element appear on a single natural line after line
         * continuation characters have been removed. Note that it is not sufficient to only
         * examine the character preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line
         * terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of contiguous backslashes for the
         * line terminator to be escaped. Since the input is processed from left to right, a
         * non-zero even number of 2n contiguous backslashes before a line terminator (or
         * elsewhere) encodes n backslashes after escape processing.
         * <p>
         * The key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first non-white
         * space character and up to, but not including, the first unescaped '=', ':', or white
         * space character other than a line terminator. All of these key termination characters
         * may be included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash character; for
         * example,
         *
         *    \:\=
         *
         * would be the two-character key ":=". Line terminator characters can be included using
         * \r and \n escape sequences. Any white space after the key is skipped; if the first
         * non-white space character after the key is '=' or ':', then it is ignored and any white
         * space characters after it are also skipped. All remaining characters on the line become
         * part of the associated element string; if there are no remaining characters, the element
         * is the empty string "". Once the raw character sequences constituting the key and
         * element are identified, escape processing is performed as described above.
         * <p>
         * As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key "Truth" and the
         * associated element value "Beauty":
         * <p>
         *     Truth = Beauty
         *             Truth:Beauty
         *         Truth                  :Beauty
         * <p>
         * As another example, the following three lines specify a single property:
         * <p>
         * fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
         *                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
         *                                  kiwi, mango
         * <p>
         * The key is "fruits" and the associated element is:
         *     "apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"
         * <p>
         * Note that a space appears before each \ so that a space will appear after each comma
         * in the final result; the \, line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation
         * line are merely discarded and are not replaced by one or more other characters.
         * <p>
         * As a third example, the line:
         *
         *   cheeses
         *
         * specifies that the key is "cheeses" and the associated element is the empty string "".
         * <p>
         * Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape sequences similar to those
         * used for character and string literals (see §3.3 and §3.10.6 of the Java Language
         * Specification). The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode escapes
         * used for characters and strings are:
         *
         *   - Octal escapes are not recognized.
         *   - The character sequence \b does not represent a backspace character.
         *   - The method does not treat a backslash character, \, before a non-valid escape
         *     character as an error; the backslash is silently dropped. For example, in a C++
         *     string the sequence "\z" would cause a compile time error. In contrast, this
         *     method silently drops the backslash. Therefore, this method treats the two
         *     character sequence "\b" as equivalent to the single character 'b'.
         *   - Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes; however, by the rule above,
         *     single and double quote characters preceded by a backslash still yield single and
         *     double quote characters, respectively.
         *
         * This method does not close the Reader upon its return.
         *
         * @param reader
         *      The Reader that provides an character stream as input.
         *
         * @throw IOException if there is an error while reading from the stream.
         * @throw IllegalArgumentException if malformed data is found while reading the properties.
         * @throw NullPointerException if the passed stream is Null.
