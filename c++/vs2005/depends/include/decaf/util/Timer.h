     * A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread.
     * Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for repeated execution at regular
     * intervals.
     *
     * Corresponding to each Timer object is a single background thread that is used to execute
     * all of the timer's tasks, sequentially. Timer tasks should complete quickly. If a timer
     * task takes excessive time to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread. This
     * can, in turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and execute
     * in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally completes.
     *
     * This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single Timer object without the
     * need for external synchronization.
     *
     * This class does not offer real-time guarantees: it schedules tasks using the wait(long)
     * method.
