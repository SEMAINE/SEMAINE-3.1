     * A kind of collection provides advanced operations than other basic
     * collections, such as insertion, extraction, and inspection.
     *
     * Generally, a queue orders its elements by means of first-in-first-out. While
     * priority queue orders its elements according to a comparator specified or the
     * elements' natural order. Furthermore, a stack orders its elements
     * last-in-first out.
     *
     * Queue does not provide blocking queue methods, which will block until the
     * operation of the method is allowed. BlockingQueue interface defines such
     * methods.
     *
     * Unlike the Java Queue interface the methods of this class cannot return null
     * to indicate that a Queue is empty since null has no meaning for elements such
     * as classes, structs and primitive types and cannot be used in a meaningful way
     * to check for an empty queue.  Methods that would have returned null in the
     * Java Queue interface have been altered to return a boolean value indicating if
     * the operation succeeded and take single argument that is a reference to the
     * location where the returned value is to be assigned.  This implies that elements
     * in the Queue must be <em>assignable</em> in order to utilize these methods.
