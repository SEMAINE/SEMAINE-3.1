    /**
     * A Session object is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming
     * messages.
     *
     * A session serves several purposes:
     *
     *  - It is a factory for its message producers and consumers.
     *  - It supplies provider-optimized message factories.
     *  - It is a factory for TemporaryTopics and TemporaryQueues.
     *  - It provides a way to create Queue or Topic objects for those clients
     *    that need to dynamically manipulate provider-specific destination
     *    names.
     *  - It supports a single series of transactions that combine work spanning
     *    its producers and consumers into atomic units.
     *  - It defines a serial order for the messages it consumes and the messages
     *    it produces.
     *  - It retains messages it consumes until they have been acknowledged.
     *  - It serializes execution of message listeners registered with its message
     *    consumers.
     *
     * A session can create and service multiple message producers and consumers.
     *
     * One typical use is to have a thread block on a synchronous MessageConsumer until
     * a message arrives. The thread may then use one or more of the Session's
     * MessageProducers.
     *
     * If a client desires to have one thread produce messages while others consume
     * them, the client should use a separate session for its producing thread.
     *
     * Certain rules apply to a session's <code>close</code> method and are detailed
     * below.
     *
     *  - There is no need to close the producers and consumers of a closed session.
     *  - The close call will block until a receive call or message listener in progress
     *    has completed. A blocked message consumer receive call returns null when this
     *    session is closed.
     *  - Closing a transacted session must roll back the transaction in progress.
     *  - The close method is the only Session method that can be called concurrently.
     *  - Invoking any other Session method on a closed session must throw an
     *    IllegalStateException. Closing a closed session must not throw  any exceptions.
     *
     * <B>Transacted Sessions</B>
     *
     * When a Session is created it can be set to operate in a Transaction based mode.  Each
     * Session then operates in a single transaction for all Producers and Consumers of that
     * Session.  Messages sent and received within a Transaction are grouped into an atomic
     * unit that is committed or rolled back together.
     *
     * For a MessageProducer this implies that all messages sent by the producer are not sent
     * to the Provider unit the commit call is made.  Rolling back the Transaction results in
     * all produced Messages being dropped.
     *
     * For a MessageConsumer this implies that all received messages are not Acknowledged until
     * the Commit call is made.  Rolling back the Transaction results in all Consumed Message
     * being redelivered to the client, the Provider may allow configuration that limits the
     * Maximum number of redeliveries for a Message.
     *
