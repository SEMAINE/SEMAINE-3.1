     * This is an Abstract class whose purpose is to provide a container
     * for the delivery mode enumeration for CMS messages.
     * <p>
     * When a client sends a <code>cms::Message</code> it can mark the Message as either
     * Persistent or Non-Persistent.  If the client feels that the Message cannot be lost in
     * transit it should mark it as Persistent, otherwise if it is allowable for a Message to
     * occasionally be lost it can mark it as Non-Persistent.  This allows the Provider to
     * balance make tradeoffs between balance and Message throughput.
     * <p>
     * The DeliveryMode covers only the transport of the Message for sending client to its
     * destination and doesn't apply to the receiving Message consumer.  The receiving
     * Consumer can drop Message's based on configuration such as memory limits or Message
     * filtering.
     * <p>
     * A message is guaranteed to be delivered once and only once by a CMS provider if the
     * delivery mode of the message is PERSISTENT and the configuration of the Message
     * consumer allows for it.
