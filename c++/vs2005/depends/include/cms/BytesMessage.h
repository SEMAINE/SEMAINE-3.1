    /**
     * A BytesMessage object is used to send a message containing a stream of unsigned
     * bytes. It inherits from the Message interface and adds a bytes message body. The
     * receiver of the message supplies the interpretation of the bytes using the methods
     * added by the BytesMessage interface.
     *
     * The BytesMessage methods are based largely on those found in decaf.io.DataInputStream
     * and decaf.io.DataOutputStream.
     *
     * Although the CMS API allows the use of message properties with byte messages, they are
     * typically not used, since the inclusion of properties may affect the format.
     *
     * The primitive types can be written explicitly using methods for each type.  Because the
     * C++ language is more limited when dealing with primitive types the JMS equivalent generic
     * read and write methods that take Java objects cannot be provided in the CMS API.
     *
     * When the message is first created, and when clearBody is called, the body of the message
     * is in write-only mode. After the first call to reset has been made, the message body is
     * in read-only mode. After a message has been sent, the client that sent it can retain and
     * modify it without affecting the message that has been sent. The same message object can
     * be sent multiple times. When a message has been received, the provider has called reset
     * so that the message body is in read-only mode for the client.
     *
     * If clearBody is called on a message in read-only mode, the message body is cleared and
     * the message is in write-only mode.
     *
     * If a client attempts to read a message in write-only mode, a MessageNotReadableException
     * is thrown.
     *
     * If a client attempts to write a message in read-only mode, a MessageNotWriteableException
     * is thrown.
